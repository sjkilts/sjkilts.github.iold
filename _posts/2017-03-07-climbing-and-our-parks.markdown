*[intro paragraph]* so many of my great memories are set in state and national parks & forests. These places are a treasure and need to be recognized and protected. Conservation in America is unique and beautiful etc … 

Intertwined with the history of our parks is the history of climbing [alps, shawnangunks, muir, rainier, tetons etc … expound on the history in an entertaining, concise way]

To recognize this history & acknowledge the beauty of our parks & monuments, and especially to bring attention to the current threats to our public lands *(reference bears ears, trump, trump again. What a dick*)

Blahdeblah releasing this series in commemoration. 10% of all profits (sales?) will be donated to protect the bears ears or whomever Patagonia is giving money to? 

*This needs to be released on website as an article. do I need a Facebook page? The one Alex set up for me? Should come up with a shop name … ?. Also needs to be linked to with Instagram pics of drawings, portfolio post of drawings. Twitter as well? I think if I had a Facebook I could easily link Insta + twitter?*

You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
